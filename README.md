# Premis Test

The project is bootstrapped with Create React App \
I additionaly added a few tests just to show that I know how to write unit tests.
I used faker.js to create mock data **The images do change when the list is filtered due to faker.js since it fetches random images from the same url**.

```bash
# Start the application
yarn start
    # or
npm run start

# Run the tests
yarn test
    # or
npm run test
```
